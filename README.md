## üîç Overview

This repository provides the implementation of **DTGNN**, a framework designed to address class imbalance biomedical images in graph classification tasks. The method dynamically adjusts graph topology during training and incorporates class-aware strategies to improve performance, especially on underrepresented classes.

The implementation supports multi-label or binary classification tasks using PyTorch Geometric, and includes tools for preprocessing, evaluation, training, visualization, and reproducibility each of which in their individual folder for easier management.
