"""
    The goal of this script is to implement the MLSMOTE algorithm for multi-label oversampling.
    It generates synthetic samples by interpolating between feature vectors and combining label sets.
    The script uses a NearestNeighbors implemented in sklearn.
    The synthetic samples are saved as NumPy arrays for further use.
    The script assumes that the features and labels have been pre-computed and saved in NumPy format.
