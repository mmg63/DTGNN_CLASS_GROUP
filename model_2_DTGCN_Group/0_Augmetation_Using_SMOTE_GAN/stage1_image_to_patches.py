    This file is used to just extract patches from the images and save them in a folder.
    The patches are then used to train the autoencoder on stage 2. The aim of training the autoencoder is for reconstruction the images on stage 5.

# This code extracts patches from images in the specified folder and saves them in a new directory.
# The patches are of size 256x256 pixels.
# The patches are saved with filenames indicating their original image and patch index.
# This is useful for training models that require smaller input sizes or for data augmentation.
